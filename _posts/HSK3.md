The App: https://williamapp.shinyapps.io/HSK3_Mini_Test/

One of my first apps, built for my own itch. I'm learning Mandarin and the standard Mandarin test, on the Mainland at least, is the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi. It comes in 6 levels, I was taking the third, and all the practice tests sucked. I thought about making my own for a while but figured I would need to learn Python or something else. 

But while I was taking some Datacamp courses I realized that underneath it was probably just a Shiny presentation, with a special library for the code. Even if not, it works well enough. Got one or two bugs I can't figure out, the worst one is inputing chinese characters because R wants UTF-8 and I've got no way to force the user to use it, or even type it in. Meh.

Still works well though.
